# Maths

In this repository I try some simple math problems in different programming languages.

## Infinite nested radical

The first project solves for `x` when the user enters `y` in:

$$
x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \dots}}} = y
$$

The nested radical equals $\sqrt{y}$, so the solution is:

$$
x = y - \sqrt{y}
$$

## ASCII Mandelbrot set

The second project draws a Mandelbrot fractal directly in the terminal. For
each point $c$, it repeats:

$$
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c, \qquad z_0 = 0
$$

Points that do not escape are drawn with `@`; the other characters show how
quickly the sequence grows beyond the escape radius.

Compile and run it with a C++17 compiler:

```sh
c++ -std=c++17 -O2 mandelbrot.cpp -o mandelbrot
./mandelbrot
```

## Ulam prime spiral

The third project places the positive integers in a square spiral and marks
every prime number with `##`. The primes form surprisingly strong diagonal
patterns even though they become less common as the numbers grow.

Compile it with a C++17 compiler and optionally choose an odd grid size from 5
to 99 (the default is 31):

```sh
c++ -std=c++17 -O2 ulam_spiral.cpp -o ulam_spiral
./ulam_spiral 41
```
